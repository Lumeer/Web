          <p><strong>NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE</strong></p>

          <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Lumeer hereby grants you a limited, revocable, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the Software.</p>

          <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you may remotely access the Service at lumeer.io and other Servers provided by Lumeer.  Your use of and access to the Software and the Service is conditioned upon the following:</p>

          <p>You shall not (i) copy, modify, adapt, translate or otherwise create derivative works of the Software, or permit others to do so; (ii) reverse engineer, de-compile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Software, except to the extent expressly permitted by the law in effect in the jurisdiction in which you are located, or permit others to do so; (iii) rent, lease, sell, assign or otherwise transfer rights in or to the Deploy Code or the Service; (iv) remove any proprietary notices or labels on the Deploy Code or placed by the Service; or (v) use, post, transmit or introduce any device, software or routine which interferes or attempts to interfere with the operation of the Service or the Software.

          <p>This license will terminate immediately if you fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement.  Upon such termination, you shall destroy all originals and copies of the Deploy Code in your possession and cease any further use of the Service without the express written consent of Lumeer.</p>

          <p><strong>USAGE RULES</strong></p>

          <p>The Service is offered to you to help you with the operation of your business.  You agree not to use the products or services provided through or in connection with the Service to: (i) conduct any business that is unlawful, (ii) infringe or otherwise violate a third party's rights, (iii) collect information about third parties, without their express consent; or (iv) interfere with or disrupt the Service or Servers.</p>

          <p>Lumeer reserves the right to disclose any information or materials as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or government request, or to edit, refuse to post or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, from the Servers, at Lumeer's sole and absolute discretion, without notice.</p>

          <p><strong>FEES AND SERVICES</strong></p>

          <p>The fees for the Service are as posted at <a href="plans.html">http://www.lumeer.io/plans.html</a> unless otherwise stated on a valid written or electronic purchase order (which has been accepted by Lumeer in writing); provided, however, that any additional or conflicting terms contained in any purchase order, standardized form or correspondence, which are in addition to or conflict with this Agreement, shall be null and void unless such terms and conditions are contained in an amendment to this Agreement duly executed by both parties hereto.  Lumeer reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service for your failure to remit payment in a timely manner.  Lumeer may change its fees and payment policies for the Service from time to time.  The changes to the policy are effective after Lumeer provides you with at least thirty (30) days' notice of the changes by posting the changes at <a href="plans.html">http://www.lumeer.io/plans.html</a>.  Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars.  You are responsible for paying all fees associated with your Account.</p>

          <p>Amounts not paid by you to Lumeer when due may bear interest at the lesser of (i) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, and (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.</p>

          <p>You understand and agree that your Service fee consists of a monthly fee.  The monthly fee applies to all Accounts even if your Account is inactive.  Monthly fees automatically recur every month unless you properly close your account with Lumeer.  Monthly fees are charged at the beginning of your monthly cycle, beginning at the terminiation of the free trial period and continuing every month thereafter.</p>

          <p>Accounts can be closed at any time. If the account is closed before the end of the term no refunds are available for the remainder of that current term.</p>

          <p><strong>TERM; AUTOMATIC RENEWAL</strong></p>

          <p>The term of Accounts is indefinite unless terminated at any time in Lumeer's sole and absolute discretion.  This Agreement, as may be amended from time to time, shall remain in full force and effect for so long as your Account is valid.</p>

          <p><strong>FREE TRIALS </strong></p>

          <p>From time to time Lumeer may offer a free trial of the Service to prospective customers.  Lumeer reserves the right to discontinue the offering of free trial Service without notice.  Free trials are meant to let prospective customers experience the Service before committing to it.  Use of a free trial Service for anything other than the above is prohibited.  Furthermore, you agree that you are not allowed to (i) open more than one trial account, and/or (ii) upon termination of your free trial account open a new trial account.</p>

          <p>One type of free trial offering requires payment information at the time of sign up.  This type of free trial account automatically converts to a regular paying Account at the end of the trial period.  If the trial account is not closed within the trial period, regular fees will apply immediately thereafter.</p>

          <p>Another type of free trial account requires no payment information at sign up.  Unless you convert your free trial account to a paying account within thirty (30) days of opening your account, Lumeer reserves the right to discontinue your account at the end of such thirty (30) day trial period and delete all of your Customer Data and account information without notice.</p>

          <p>Free trial account users additionally agree that you (i) will not use more capacity and resources than allocated to your account, (ii) will not hide or otherwise tamper with Lumeer branding on your confirmation pages, (iii) will maintain accurate and up to date contact and, to the extent collected by Lumeer, billing information, and (iv) agree to receive sales and marketing emails from Lumeer and its partners.  Lumeer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, immediately terminate your service, upgrade your free account to a regular, paying Account, and/or charge appropriate fees if any of the requirements above are not met.</p>

          <p><strong>BETA PROGRAMS</strong></p>

          <p>From time to time, Lumeer may offer access to beta software to interested parties.  Beta software is software that is not officially released, and may contain problems or bugs, and is not warranted by Lumeer in any way.  Any beta services are provided "as is" for evaluation and testing purposes only, and beta users are advised to not rely on the features or performance of such services for any reason.  By registering for and using beta services, you acknowledge that you are accessing a pre-release evaluation of such services and that such services and/or any products and services offered in connection therewith may contain bugs, may not operate properly or perform all intended functions, may interfere with the functioning of other applications, and may cause errors, data loss or other problems.  Lumeer shall not be liable for any damages, including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental or consequential damages or for loss of data, profits, or revenue incurred by you or third parties.</p>

          <p>As a beta user, you agree that you shall promptly report to Lumeer any failure of the applicable beta service to perform in accordance with applicable documentation, and will provide such other information relating to the beta service as Lumeer may reasonably request.  At Lumeer's request, you will provide a written evaluation of the beta service in a form reasonably requested by Lumeer.  You grant Lumeer an unrestricted, royalty-free right to use all such feedback for purposes of marketing, public relations, correcting and/or enhancing the beta service and developing additional products and services.</p>

          <p>Lumeer's beta programs have a fixed duration.  At the end of a beta program you may be offered the opportunity to convert your beta account to a regular Account.  Beta accounts that are not converted to a regular Account are deleted at the end of the beta program and all Customer Data is lost.  You agree that if you do not convert your beta account to a regular Account, you will remove all Lumeer Software and Deploy Code from your websites immediately at the conclusion of the beta program.</p>

          <p><strong>PRIVACY</strong></p>

          <p>By registering for the Service, you authorize Lumeer to collect, store and process Customer Data subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Lumeer Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy"), the current version of which is posted at <a href="privacy.html">http://www.lumeer.io/privacy.html</a>, and you represent and warrant that the collection, storage and processing of such Customer Data, as provided in this Agreement and consistent with the Privacy Policy, does not breach or violate any contractual or legal obligations that you may have to any party.  You further understand and agree that the Privacy Policy may change from time to time without notice in Lumeer's sole and absolute discretion.</p>

          <p>When you initially create an account, you may be asked whether or not you wish to receive marketing and other non-critical Service-related communications from Lumeer and our partners from time to time.  You may opt out of receiving such communications at that time or at any subsequent time by changing your preference under Account Information. Free Lumeer account users will not have the option of opting out unless they terminate their free account or upgrade to a paying Account.  Please be aware that because the Service is a hosted online application, Lumeer occasionally may need to notify all users of the Service (whether or not they have opted out as described above) of important announcements regarding the operation of the Service.  If you are or become a paying customer of the Service, you agree that Lumeer can disclose the fact that you are a paying customer and the edition of the Service that you are using.</p>

          <p>You shall ensure that during use of the Service, the Website shall have a privacy policy that (i) clearly and conspicuously notifies visitors to the Website that the Website is using services hosted by Lumeer; (ii) provides a direct link to the Privacy Policy web-page with the following language, "You should refer to the Lumeer Privacy Policy to learn how they collect and use information. You can find the Lumeer Privacy Policy here: <a href="privacy.html">http://www.lumeer.io/privacy.html</a>"; (iii) otherwise fully complies with applicable law; and (iv) protects privacy in a manner consistent with the Privacy Policy and with the principles of an industry-approved privacy certification program in the applicable jurisdiction (e.g., TRUSTe).</p>

          <p><strong>ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND DATA</strong></p>

          <p>Lumeer does not own any Customer Data.  You, not Lumeer, shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or right to use of all Customer Data, and Lumeer shall not be responsible or liable for the deletion, correction, destruction, damage, loss or failure to store any Customer Data.  Lumeer reserves the right to withhold, remove and/or discard Customer Data without notice for any breach of this Agreement, including, without limitation, your non-payment.  Upon termination of your Account, your right to access or use Customer Data immediately ceases, and Lumeer shall have no obligation to maintain or forward any Customer Data.</p>

          <p><strong>TAXES</strong></p>

          <p>Lumeer shall not be liable for taxes and other governmental fees and assessments to be paid which are related to purchases made from you or from the Server.  You agree that you shall be solely responsible for all taxes, fees, and assessments of any nature associated with products or services sold through the use of or with the aid of the Services.</p>

          <p><strong>SECURITY AND STORAGE OF INFORMATION</strong></p>

          <p>Lumeer has certain security measures in place to help prevent the loss, misuse or adulteration of Customer Data stored on the Servers.  These measures include Secure Socket Layer encryption and the use of a firewall.  Any questions or concern about security can be addressed <a href="contact.html">http://www.lumeer.io/contact.html</a>.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lumeer shall have no obligation or responsibility to preserve, archive, store or otherwise protect the integrity of the Customer Data against corruption, deletion or destruction.  Customer Data is not stored for an indefinite amount of time.</p>

          <p><strong>ENHANCING AND MODIFYING THE SERVICE</strong></p>

          <p>Lumeer reserves the right to enhance, upgrade, or modify the Service with or without notice to you.  Lumeer shall not be liable to you or any third party should Lumeer exercise its right to enhance or modify the Service.</p>

          <p><strong>INDEMNIFICATION</strong></p>

          <p>You shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Lumeer, at your expense, against any and all third-party claims, actions, proceedings, and suits brought against Lumeer or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates, and all related liabilities, damages, settlements, penalties, fines, costs or expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation expenses) incurred by Lumeer or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates, arising out of or relating to (i) your breach of this Agreement, (ii) your negligence or misconduct in connection with the Service, or (iii) your violations of applicable law in connection with the Service.</p>

          <p><strong>THIRD PARTY TERMS</strong></p>

          <p>If you provide access to your forms, your Account or any portion thereof to any third party or use the Service to collect information from or on behalf of any third party (a "Third Party"), whether or not you are authorized to do so by Lumeer, these Third Party Terms shall apply to you.</p>

          <p>You shall ensure that each Third Party abides by the terms of this Agreement.  Any information of a Third Party that is considered confidential information of such Third Party shall be treated as confidential by you and shall not be disclosed to any other third party.  Each Third Party shall be considered a customer of you, and not a customer of Lumeer; provided, however, that Lumeer reserves the right to enforce the terms of this Agreement against such Third Parties and you shall provide that Lumeer is a third party beneficiary with respect to your agreement with the Third Party.</p>

          <p>Lumeer makes no representations or warranties for the direct or indirect benefit of any Third Party.  With respect to Third Parties, you shall take all measures necessary to disclaim any and all representations or warranties that may pertain to Lumeer, the Service or the Software, or use thereof.  You shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend Lumeer, at your expense, against any and all third-party claims, actions, proceedings, and suits brought against Lumeer or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates, and all related liabilities, damages, settlements, penalties, fines, costs or expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation expenses) incurred by Lumeer, or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates, arising out of or relating to (i) any representations and warranties made by you concerning any aspect of the Service or the Software to Third Parties; (ii) any claims made by or on behalf of any Third Party pertaining directly or indirectly to your use of the Service or the Software; (iii) violations of your obligations of privacy to any Third Party; and (iv) any claims with respect to acts or omissions of Third Parties in connection with the Service or the Software that would otherwise be a breach of this Agreement by you.</p>

          <p><strong>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</strong></p>

          <p>Lumeer does not warrant or represent that the use of the Service will be correct, accurate, timely or otherwise reliable.  You specifically agree that Lumeer shall not be responsible for unauthorized access to or alteration of the Customer Data or data from the Website.</p>

          <p>THE SERVICE AND THE SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES, CLAIMS OR REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY LUMEER, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE AND THE SOFTWARE INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NOR ARE THERE ANY WARRANTIES CREATED BY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR TRADE USAGE.  LUMEER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE AND/OR THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR NEEDS OR BE FREE FROM ERRORS, OR THAT ERRORS WILL BE FIXED, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED.  THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT AND FORMED THE BASIS FOR DETERMINING THE PRICE CHARGED FOR THE SERVICE.  SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSION OF AN IMPLIED WARRANTY, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

          <p><strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong></p>

          <p>LUMEER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD-PARTY CLAIMANT FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST REVENUE, PROFITS OR DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THE SERVICE), OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED ON A CLAIM OR ACTION OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER TORT, BREACH OF ANY STATUTORY DUTY, INDEMNITY OR CONTRIBUTION, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LUMEER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THE EXCLUSION CONTAINED IN THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE FAILURE OF THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY PROVIDED IN THE FOREGOING PARAGRAPH.</p>

          <p>SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS IN THIS AND THE FOREGOING PARAGRAPH MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

          <p>Lumeer's cumulative liability to you or any other party for any loss or damages resulting from any claims, demands, or actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall not exceed the total fees paid by you to Lumeer for use of the Service.</p>

          <p><strong>PROPRIETARY RIGHTS NOTICE</strong></p>

          <p>Title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in and to the Software, Lumeer's confidential information, and any other Lumeer information and materials, and the Service, shall remain with Lumeer.  Lumeer reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this Agreement.</p>

          <p><strong>CUSTOMER REFERENCE</strong></p>

          <p>You hereby grant Lumeer the right to use your trade name and/or your corporate logo in connection with Lumeer's promotional materials and/or website to identify you as a customer of Lumeer.</p>

          <p>You may have access to information that is confidential to Lumeer ("Confidential Information").  Confidential Information shall include any information that is clearly identified in writing at the time of disclosure as confidential as well as any information that, based on the circumstances under which it was disclosed, a reasonable person would believe to be confidential.  Lumeer's Confidential Information shall include, without limitation, the Service, Software, documentation, formulas, methods, know how, processes, designs, new products, developmental work, marketing requirements, marketing plans, licensee names, prospective licensee names, the terms and pricing under this Agreement, and the results of any comparative or other benchmarking tests with respect to the Service or the Software, in each case regardless of whether such information is identified as confidential.  Confidential Information includes all information received from third parties that you are obligated to treat as confidential and oral information that is identified by Lumeer as confidential.  This obligation of confidentiality does not apply to any information that is or becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission by you, was in your lawful possession prior to the disclosure without any restriction on disclosure, or is independently developed by you without use of or reference to such Confidential Information.  If you are required to disclose such Confidential Information to any court or government authority, then you agree to provide Lumeer with sufficient written notice prior to your disclosure to enable Lumeer to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent such disclosure.  Such obligations of confidentiality shall survive any termination of this Agreement indefinitely.</p>

          <p>You agree, unless required by law, (i) not to make Confidential Information available in any form to any third party (including but not limited to entities or individuals that market, distribute or provide web database software or services) except to your employees or agents who are required to know such Confidential Information to allow you to exercise your rights under this Agreement, and (ii) not to use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than in the performance of this Agreement.  You shall not disclose the results of any performance tests of the Software or Service to any third party without Lumeer's prior written approval.  You agree to take all necessary steps to ensure that Confidential Information is not disclosed or distributed by your employees or agents in breach of this Agreement.  You acknowledge and agree that, due to the unique nature of Confidential Information, there can be no adequate remedy at law for breach of this section of the Agreement and that such breach would cause irreparable harm to Lumeer, therefore Lumeer shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief, in addition to whatever remedies it might have at law, in equity and/or under this Agreement.</p>

          <p><strong>U.S. GOVERNMENT RIGHTS </strong></p>

          <p>If the use of the Service is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), in accordance with 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions), the Government's rights in the Software, including its rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display or disclose the Software or any related documentation, shall be subject in all respects to the commercial license rights and restrictions provided in this Agreement.</p>

          <p><strong>MISCELLANEOUS; APPLICABLE LAW AND VENUE</strong></p>

          <p>Lumeer shall be excused from performance hereunder to the extent that performance is prevented, delayed or obstructed by causes beyond its reasonable control.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.  The waiver by either party of any default or breach of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach.  Neither this Agreement nor any rights granted hereunder may be sold, leased, assigned, or otherwise transferred, in whole or in part, by you, and any such attempted assignment shall be void and of no effect without the advance written consent of Lumeer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective heirs, successors, permitted assigns, and legal representatives.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to its conflict of laws principles.  You agree, in the event any claim or suit is brought in connection with Lumeer's provision of the Services to you, to submit to the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and agree to the courts of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania as the appropriate forum.</p>
