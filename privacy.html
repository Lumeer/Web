          <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
          <em>For Website Users and Clients</em><p><em>Last modified May 9th, 2017.</em></p>

          <strong>OVERVIEW</strong>
          <p>lumeer.io (together with its affiliates, "Lumeer") is committed to respecting your privacy and the privacy of the information in your account.  That is why we have established this Privacy Statement.  Our intention is to treat your information with utmost care and consideration. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact Lumeer as outlined below.</p>

          <p>We want you to know that we are not in the business of selling or renting individuals' personal data to other companies for any purpose.</p>

          <p>This Privacy Statement contains Lumeer's handling of personally identifiable information that is gathered when you are on Lumeer's site, and when you use Lumeer's services.  This Privacy Statement applies exclusively to the site www.lumeer.io (the "Site").  This policy does not cover or apply to the practices of organizations that use our services on their websites, that Lumeer does not own or control, information collected offline, or to non- Lumeer employees.</p>

          <strong>COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong>
          <p>Lumeer collects personally identifiable information when you register for an Lumeer account, when you fill out any form requesting information, support, or product and service information, and when you subscribe to our news.  Lumeer may also receive personally identifiable information from its business partners.</p>

          <p>Lumeer may collect the following personally identifiable information: your name, title, phone number, email address, mailing address, website URL, employer or company.  You also have the option of supplying us with your occupation, and type of business or industry.  Additionally, when you sign up for an Lumeer paid service, we collect your billing information, including your credit card number, expiration date, and billing address.</p>

          <p>Lumeer also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, browser type, referrer page, domain name, access time, entry page, exit page, operating system type, and search engine keywords used.</p>

          <p>We mainly use the information we collect to measure our business success, to identify the most effective ways to reach you, the customer, to more effectively meet your needs and requests for certain new product features and services, and to contact you about product upgrades. Additionally, if you have chosen to receive email communications, you will receive our infrequent news and announcements.</p>

          <strong>DATA HOSTED BY LUMEER </strong>
          <p>Lumeer hosts the data stored in your Lumeer account.  That data is strictly your property and is governed by the Lumeer's Terms of Service Agreement.  The data in your account is not accessible to anyone, unless you make it accessible.</p>

          <strong>PRIVACY SHIELD FRAMEWORK</strong>
          <p>Lumeer complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States.  Lumeer has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a></p>

          <p>
          In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Lumeer commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information.  EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Lumeer at: </p>

          <p>Lumeer has further committed to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact the EU DPAs for more information or to file a complaint.  The services of EU DPAs are provided at no cost to you.</p>
