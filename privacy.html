              <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
              <p><em>Updated on May 20th 2018</em></p>


              <p>
                On May 25th 2018 a Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR) (further in text as <em>regulation</em>). In relation to this, the <strong>Answer Institute s.r.o.</strong>, company ID 06618278, with registered office at Purkyňova 649/127, 612 00 Brno – Medlánky, Czech Republic, registered in the Commercial register maintained by the Regional Court in Brno, file no. C 102990 (further in text as <em>controller</em>) adopted these Principles of Data Protection (further in text as <em>principles</em>) that enter into force and effect on 25th May 2018.
              </p><p>
                For the purpose of these principles:
              </p><p>
                <em>Personal data</em> means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (<em>data subject</em>); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. These principles apply to all relationships between the controller and data subjects which for the purpose of these principles are customers, potential customers, suppliers, potential suppliers of the controller and controller’s job applicants.
              </p><p>
                These principles shall apply to all data processing conducted by the controller unless agreed otherwise between the controller and data subject.
              </p><p>
                Controller hereby declares that he operates and holds all copyrights related to the software solution Lumeer.
              </p>
              <h2>Personal data collected by the controller</h2>
              <p>In regard with its activities the controller collects following data for the purpose as follows:</p>
              <ol type="a">
                <li><strong>Product Distribution</strong><br/>
                  In regard with these activities the controller processes following personal data of its customers: name, surname, address or seat of registered office, phone number, email, eventually company ID and VAT ID. Such information are disclosed to the controller by the customer. The information are used for the purpose of granting a license to use Lumeer application, payment of a license fee by the data subject via paywall and to comply with legal obligations in regard to the business activity, e.g. to invoice, to keep records and withhold and pay taxes. These information can be also used for recovery of the customer’s debt, e.g. for the purpose of performance of the contract in legitimate interest of the controller.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data submitted to Lumeer by the subjects</strong><br/>
                  These data are saved into Lumeer by the data subject via its encrypted user account. Controller processes these data in order to perform the contract only to the extent defined by the customer. Controller shall not actively access such saved data. The software solution Lumeer is saved in cloud provided to the controller by DigitalOcean, LLC.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Supply of services by external suppliers</strong><br/>
                  In regard with this activity the controller also uses services of external suppliers – natural persons. Therefore the controller processes data of its external suppliers if it is necessary for facilitation of supplier’s activity. Such data include: name, surname, date of birth, address or seat of registered office, phone number, email, bank account number, eventually company ID, VAT ID and a signature. Such information are obtained directly from the data subjects and processed to the necessary extent in order to perform the contract entered into between the supplier and controller and further, to comply with legal obligations in regard to the business activity e.g. to invoice, to keep records and withhold and pay taxes.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Hiring of new employees and potential suppliers</strong><br/>
                  In regard with this activity the controller processes personal data of job applicants and potential new suppliers to the extent in which the data subjects themselves provide such data to the controller while such data are processed in respect to controller’s legitimate interests.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sending of up-to-date information – newsletters</strong><br/>
                  Subject to data subjects’ consent the controller shall send to the data subjects information on controller’s products and news – newsletters. Newsletters provide the customers with up-to-date information allowing them to use services provided by the controller in full. In regard with this activity the controller processes name, surname, and email of data subjects provided such data shall be processed throughout the time a valid consent is given. In this regard the controller uses services of MailChimp.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Communication with customers</strong><br/>
                  Controller also uses online chat to communicate with the data subjects. Controller’s legitimate interest includes providing the customers or potential customers who contact the controller by themselves with required information in shortest time possible. In this case the controller processes only data provided by the data subjects. In this regard the controller uses services of Drift.com. Further, controller communicates with the data subjects via contact form provided that a consent was given.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Other activities</strong><br/>
                  In regard with its business activity the controller shall process other personal data provided by the data subjects. Processing of such data can be performed only on legal grounds and to the extent necessary to meet the purpose to which such data were given by the data subject.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Personal data shall be saved by the controller to CRM system provided by HubSpot, Inc.

              </p><p>
                All the processors above provide sufficient guarantees of implementing proper technical and organizational provisions, so that the data processing complies with the laws and the rights of the data subjects are protected. Processor can also engage a third party processor provided that such processor complies with the same data protection conditions that the processor undertook to comply with in the contract with the controller.
              </p><p>
                Personal data may be transferred to third countries or to an international organization located out of the European Union area, i.e. to processors in the USA. All such transfers are necessary for performance of the contract entered into between the data subject and controller. All such third party processors are either members of the European Union or belong to the EU – USA Privacy shield, to be found at <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list">www.privacyshield.gov/list</a>. Pursuant to Article 45 (9) the European Commission adopted a decision that deems the Privacy shield protection adequate. In this regard such data transfers do not require any special approval.
